# image2PDF
image2PDF is an Android app that allows users to upload up to 10 images and sort them according to their preference. Once they're satisfied with the order of the images, they can click the export button to consolidate the images into one PDF file in the specified order.

I created this app to solve a problem I faced during the height of the pandemic. When classes were held online, some professors required homework assignments to be turned in as PDFs to ensure uniformity. For classes like mathematics, the homework assignments tended to span several sheets of paper because I had to show my work for long and complicated problems. 
I didn’t have a scanner at home to scan my homework, so I used my phone to take pictures of my sheets of paper for a problem set. There weren’t many apps that allowed me to order the images and export as one PDF file on the Google Play store. There were some that allowed an image to be exported to PDF, but I had to consolidate all my pages of homework in the correct order into a single PDF file.
After I took pictures of the sheets of my homework assignment, I would then email the pictures to myself, download the pictures on my computer and rearrange the order of the pictures according to the problem number on an image to PDF website (the few free websites that were available also had export limits), and then export to a PDF. 
There weren’t many apps that allowed me to do this on the Google Play store. The ones that did were either needlessly complicated or were paid apps. This app is free and ad-supported. The interface is incredibly simple: upload images, re-arrange, and export! 

Also, one final note, I am in the process of trying to get this app listed on the Google Play store. I do have a developer account on there, but Google recently changed their app requirements to [require an app to have 20 internal testers in 14 days in order for an app to be accepted and listed on the Google Play store](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465?hl=en). 
The intention is to ensure higher quality apps, but unfortunately this only harms developers who are both legitimate and small. Unfortunately, I do not have 20 testers at my disposal to meet this requirement to publish my app. This requirement is universally being criticized by many Android developers, so if that requirement ends up being changed in the future, I'll gladly upload this app.  You can still sideload the app if you want. [The .aab is available in the releases directory](https://github.com/gcmaidana/image2PDF/blob/master/release/app-release.aab).
The only difference between the release version and the code provided here is that the release version has ads. The code in this repository uses and shows test ads, whereas the release version uses and shows actual ads.



This app was made in Android Studio using Java, XML and AdMob. The app logo was also made by me in Adobe Illustrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Below you will find some app screenshots.
